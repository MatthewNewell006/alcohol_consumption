<h3>Correlating Alcohol Consumption within Cold and Warm climates</h3>



From cocktails to craft brews, the "art of the drink" is a way of life for some, a pitfall for others, but coveted by many. Where is the line bewteen creation and consumption? What allows some to maintian a responsible approach to alcohol while others simply lose themelves in it? I wil be looking into the rate of consumptions in both warm and cold climates. Do the "dog days of summer" attribute to the mentality of "cracking open a cold one"? Or does life in cooler regions make you want to bundle up and get down? Here I will being taking a look at alcohol consumption at different temperatures to see if there is a pattern.

<h3>Data Mining</h3>

The process of finding adequate data to compare how temperature effects liquor sales was daunting. The information was spoty at best across multiple data sites like Kaggle and Data.Gov. I found a lot of insufficient data and most of it pertained to a global parsing. I was looking for something pertaining to the United States. I finally found info that I was looking for. The closest year I could find to align properly, was for 2015. Once I had what I was looking for, I proceeded to streamline it best I could. Originaly I was going to compare amount of sales against temperatures in every state. However looking for a munging took up most of the time to simply attain a solid comoparison. Below is a comparison of the number of drinks that were sold in the year 2015.

<li>There were 17 missing cells in May. Not sure why there was this gap but still had 250 observations to continue analysis.</li>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<li>A closer inspections reveals that the ideal temperature for the most sales of beer, wine, and liquor is 102Â°</li>

Performing a couple of correlation tests I was able to deduce that there is a good significance between the amount of alcohol comsumed as it pertains to how high or low the temperature is.
