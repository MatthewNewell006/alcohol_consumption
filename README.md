Correlating Alcohol Consumption within Cold and Warm climates



From cocktails to craft brews, the "art of the drink" is a way of life for some, a pitfall for others, but coveted by many. Where is the line bewteen creation and consumption? What allows some to maintian a responsible approach to alcohol while others simply lose themelves in it? I wil be looking into the rate of consumptions in both warm and cold climates. Do the "dog days of summer" attribute to the mentality of "cracking open a cold one"? Or does life in cooler regions make you want to bundle up and get down? Here I will being taking a look at alcohol consumption at different temperatures to see if there is a pattern.
