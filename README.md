Creating a Recommendation System


Thought of as a subclass of information filtering systems, recommender systems look to predict the best "rating" or "preference" a person would give. As such these systems optimize objectives like "total clicks", "total revenue", and "overall sales", to "recommend" related items and options based on user input. Say someone gave a high rating to a particular item online, or revisited a particular item or site. Utilizing data of that persons online presence and actions, I will build a system that will in turn "recommend" related items, places of interest, etc. back to that person.
